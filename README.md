A Python implementation of the **Luhn Algorithm**, which is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. This project was part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), specifically the *Validate a Credit Card Number* project.
